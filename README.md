# CareBot

An AI-powered Intelligent Virtual Assistant

# Overview

A chatbot for e-commerce gives you the power to engage with new, existing, and potential customers with real-time, text-style messaging, without the involvement of the live person

# Benefits

1. Cost efficiencies: 
Simple chatbots help drive contact center cost efficiencies by taking on the basic and frequently asked customer service inquiries. This reduces the number of inbound contacts a contact center receives, while also freeing up agents to handle more complex tasks.

2. Increased customer satisfaction: 
Chatbots improve customer satisfaction by providing immediate assistance to customer FAQs or simpler requests that can be automated. This results in higher first contact resolution and instant customer service resolution.

3. Superior customer experience: 
Quick answers, high first contact resolution, and instant customer service resolution all work together to create a positive customer experience that lends itself to collecting feedback. Chatbots can collect customer feedback with surveys in a natural, conversational tone. This encourages customers to provide more detailed answers you can use to further enhance customer experiences.
